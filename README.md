# Sombrero FX

## What is this?

Sombrero provides ReShade FX and GLSL shader implementations for rendering a virtual display with IMU head-tracking support. *Sombrero provides shade for your head. GET IT??!*

## How does it work?

The shader requires real-time IMU data in the form of uniform variables, populated from a background application (e.g. my custom [vkBasalt fork](https://github.com/rebroad/vkBasalt) or [Breezy Desktop's](https://github.com/rebroad/breezy-desktop) GNOME extension).
